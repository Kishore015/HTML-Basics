            <h1>Calculated New Zealand win the long game</h1>

            <p>It would be easy to pigeonhole New Zealand's victory over England as cathartic, retribution for what happened in the World Cup final back in 2019. No doubt there will be some of those thoughts in the New Zealand camp, particularly for Jimmy Neesham after what he went through in that Lord's Super Over. But viewing this six-wicket victory in such a way ignores the larger context of New Zealand's cricket. After all, this is a team that has made a habit of winning clutch matches across all formats. This is simply another one to add to the list.</p>
            <p>New Zealand are World Test Champions, of course. They made the 2015 and 2019 50-over World Cup finals as well. They will play either Pakistan or Australia in Dubai on Sunday with the aim of winning their first ever T20 World Cup. This was not an underdog victory by any means. New Zealand are a team which lives for tournament play. They may be the nice guys of men's cricket but they are utterly ruthless when they get into the heat of a winner takes all game.</p>
            <p>In knock-out matches, opponents just can't shake New Zealand off, like a toddler who won't let go of their mum's leg. Then when they see an opportunity to make a decisive play, they take it. That was how they defeated India in the World Test Championship Final during the summer. It is also how they managed to stay in that World Cup Final at Lord's so long against an England team that were, on paper at least, far stronger than them. It was also the template for New Zealand's victory today.</p>
